# NewClockRadioApril8
Creating this from scratch again
Clock Radio User Stories
• As a developer, I want to create a ClockRadio class.
• As a developer, I want my class to have member variables to track a ClockRadio’s current time, current radio station, whether the alarm is on or off, and the time the alarm is set to. (Use strings to represent time and radio station.)
• As a developer, I want to include a ClockRadio constructor in my class. I want to use the constructor to give initial values to the member variables.
• As a developer, I want to include in my class member methods to get the current time, and to set (or change) the current time.
• As a developer, I want to include in my class member methods to get the current radio station, and to set (or change) the current radio station.
• As a developer, I want to include in my class member methods to get the current alarm time, to set (or change) the current alarm time, and to toggle the alarm on and off.
• As a developer, I want to use correct casing conventions throughout my class. Any variables, including member variables, will use “camelCasing”. Any methods or functions, including the constructor, will use “PascalCasing”.
